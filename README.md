# Uncle-Scrooge-Bank
Programming Software 1 - Project - 2019 - IFSP - Capivari

<div>Project created to conclude our course of Programming Software 1, our teacher instructed to us these objectives that were needed on the system:</div>
<ul>
  <li>1. Needed to be a bank emulation service(where you can withdraw money or deposit)</li>
  <li>2. On the withdraw you need to have 2 options of withdraw:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>1. Withdraw the money with the higher variety of notes</li>
    <li>2. Withdraw the money with the less quantity of notes</li>
  </ul>
</ul><br/>
<div>Given those points we were free to decide anything on the system, so we decided to create the app with a theme of Uncle Scrooge :D, and also we´ve got our head in to learning to use propperly a local database, so we created the SQL with MYSQL and use the Visual Studio tools to create the database.</div><br>
<div>As we were familiarized with photoshop and image eddition, we´ve created all the interface for this project, so here´s how our formularies are right now:</div><br>

<div align="center">
<img src="FrmLogin.png" alt="Login inital screen">
<br>
*To facilitate our tests we´ve created an user of Uncle Scrooge and setted It on the login screen
</div><br>

<div align="center">
<img src="FrmSaque.png" alt="Withdraw screen"><br>
After you Login theres the Withdraw formularie, were you can type in how much money you want to withdraw or if want to deposit<br>
*We´ve tried to create an interaction with where uncle scrooge point to(If use tab on the buttons his hand will point to other button), It´s cool bug kinda buggy xD
</div><br>

<div align="center">
<img src="FrmResult.png" alt="Calculated result screen"><br>
Here we have our 2 different options that you select with a radio button, you can select the withdraw with less notes or the most variety of notes possible (R$72,00 in this image)<br>
If you select one to withdraw we get bat to the withdraw screen and the text "Saldo atual:R$ X" updates with the information of how much money you have left in the account(and this also updates the info on the local database)
</div><br>

<div align="center">
<img src="FrmDeposit.png" alt="Deposit screen">
<br>
Finaly our last screen, where every note is a button and you can click on them to inform what´s the value that you want to deposit
</div>
